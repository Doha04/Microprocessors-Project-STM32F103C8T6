# Microprocessors-Project-STM32F103C8T6
 This is a microprocessors project that utilizes STM32F103C8T6 microprocessor which is a part of the panda kit.
 Our Project is a LED Pong game with two buttons and two buzzers.
 This can help you understand the basics of assembly coding.
 We are sharing this project to help struggling students whom we were when we worked on this project as we didn't find enough resources utilizing the same microprocessor we used.
